# EncQui.re
## Inference on encrypted data
In this project, I use homomorphic encryption to provide inference on encrypted health care records. We use the Intel nGraph HE transformer and Tensorflow.
## Setup
Build [Intel nGraph HE](https://github.com/IntelAI/he-transformer) and run the appropriate files as web services.
